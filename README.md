I want to analyse a bike company based on its sales from January 1st 2021 to June 30th 2023. The problem will starting into two aspects:\
    1. Analyse how to develop the sales strategy according to **Apriori Model**, which will find the association between products. \
    With the specific product selling well, the other products have a excellent sale if they have high association. \
    2. In November 24th 2021, the bike company make a decision, it posts many discount coupons to customers. \
    So I want to know how effect of this decision is. Based on the **Difference In Difference model**, \
    I can know the whether this discount coupons play a improving role in order number or not fixed other Confounders like region difference, \
    age, annual income, education level, occupation.\
